  This will create job opportunities for people with good communication and problem-solving skills.

 -> Logistics jobs: Online markets rely on logistics companies to transport goods from sellers to customers.
  This will create job opportunities for people who have experience in logistics, transportation, and distribution.

    An online market can help overcome this limitation by reaching customers anywhere in the world.

3. Limited hours: Physical stores typically have limited hours of operation, which can make it difficult for customers to shop at their convenience.
    An online market can be open 24/7, making it more convenient for customers to shop whenever they want.

    An online market can offer a wider selection of products, making it more likely that customers will find what they're looking for.

5. Inconvenience: Shopping at physical stores can be inconvenient for customers who have to travel to the store, find parking, and navigate through crowded aisles.

providing a more convenient, transparent, and secure shopping experience for customers.
